# Johnwood - theme coding example
*Based on Bedrock (https://roots.io/bedrock/)*

* This is a website built on wordpress and woocommerce. In this project I've been using webpack to compile assets. Es6, jquery, scss and php+html have been used. That's my most recent project (from week ago)

* Composer is used to install wordpress files and plugins.
* That's only a theme folder in this repo. The webpack, composer and package-json config files are in root directory.
